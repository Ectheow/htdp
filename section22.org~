** Designing Abstractions with First-Class Functions
   We have seen that functions can consume functions and how important
   that is for creating single points of control in a function. But
   functions not only can consume functions, they can also produce
   them. More precisely, expressions in the new Scheme can evaluate to
   functions. Because the body of a function definition is also an
   expression, a function can produce a function. In this section, we
   first discuss this surprising idea and then show how it is useful
   for abstracting functions and in other contexts.
